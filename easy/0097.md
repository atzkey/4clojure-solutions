# Pascal's Triangle

###### Easy
###### 

[Pascal's triangle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle) is a triangle of numbers computed using the following rules:  
- The first row is 1.- Each successive row is computed by adding together adjacent numbers in the row above, and adding a 1 to the beginning and end of the row.  
  
Write a function which returns the nth row of Pascal's Triangle.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= (__ 1) [1])
```
```clojure
(= (map __ (range 1 6))
   [     [1]
        [1 1]
       [1 2 1]
      [1 3 3 1]
     [1 4 6 4 1]])
```
```clojure
(= (__ 11)
   [1 10 45 120 210 252 210 120 45 10 1])
```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn [n]
  (let [
    ! #(apply * (range 1 (inc %1)))
    C #(/ (! %1) (* (! %2) (! (- %1 %2))))]
    (map (partial C (dec n)) (range 0 n))))
```

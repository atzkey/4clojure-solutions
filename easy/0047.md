# Contain Yourself

###### Easy
###### 

The contains? function checks if a KEY is present in a given collection. This often leads beginner clojurians to use it incorrectly with numerically indexed collections like vectors and lists.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(contains? #{4 5 6} __)
```
```clojure
(contains? [1 1 1 1 1] __)
```
```clojure
(contains? {4 :a 2 :b} __)
```
```clojure
(not (contains? [1 2 4] __))
```

# Solution
```clojure
4
```

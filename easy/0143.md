# dot product

###### Easy
###### #seqs #math

Create a function that computes the [dot product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Definition) of two sequences. You may assume that the vectors will have the same length.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= 0 (__ [0 1 0] [1 0 0]))
```
```clojure
(= 3 (__ [1 1 1] [1 1 1]))
```
```clojure
(= 32 (__ [1 2 3] [4 5 6]))
```
```clojure
(= 256 (__ [2 5 6] [100 10 1]))
```

# Solution
```clojure
#(reduce + (map (partial apply *) (map vector %1 %2)))
```

# Comparisons

###### Easy
###### 

For any orderable data type it's possible to derive all of the basic comparison operations (<, ≤, =, ≠, ≥, and >) from a single operation (any operator but = or ≠ will work). Write a function that takes three arguments, a <var>less than</var> operator for the data and two items to compare. The function should return a keyword describing the relationship between the two items. The keywords for the relationship between <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are as follows: 
- <var>x</var> = <var>y</var> → :eq
- <var>x</var> > <var>y</var> → :gt
- <var>x</var> < <var>y</var> → :lt

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= :gt (__ 
```
```clojure
(= :eq (__ (fn [x y] (
```
```clojure
(= :lt (__ (fn [x y] (
```
```clojure
(= :gt (__ > 0 2))

```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn [lt x y]
  (cond
   (lt x y) :lt
   (lt y x) :gt
   :else  :eq))
```

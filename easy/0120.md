# Sum of square of digits

###### Easy
###### #math

Write a function which takes a collection of integers as an argument. Return the count of how many elements are smaller than the sum of their squared component digits. For example: 10 is larger than 1 squared plus 0 squared; whereas 15 is smaller than 1 squared plus 5 squared.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= 8 (__ (range 10)))
```
```clojure
(= 19 (__ (range 30)))
```
```clojure
(= 50 (__ (range 100)))
```
```clojure
(= 50 (__ (range 1000)))
```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn [xs] (letfn [
  (digits [x] (map #(Integer. (str %)) (str x)))
  (sum [x] (reduce + (map #(* % %) (digits x))))]

  (count (filter #(< % (sum %)) xs))))
```

# Nothing but the Truth

###### Elementary

###### 

This is a clojure form. Enter a value which will make the form evaluate to true. Don't over think it! If you are confused, see the [getting started](/directions) page. Hint: true is equal to true.

# Test Cases

(= __ true)
```

# Solution

```clojure
true
```

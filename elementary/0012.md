# Intro to Sequences

###### Elementary

###### 

All Clojure collections support sequencing. You can operate on sequences with functions like first, second, and last.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= __ (first '(3 2 1)))
```

```clojure
(= __ (second [2 3 4]))
```

```clojure
(= __ (last (list 1 2 3)))
```

# Solution

```clojure
3
```

# Lists: conj

###### Elementary

###### 

When operating on a list, the conj function will return a new list with one or more items "added" to the front.

Note that there are two test cases, but you are expected to supply only one answer, which will cause all the tests to pass.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= __ (conj '(2 3 4) 1))
```

```clojure
(= __ (conj '(3 4) 2 1))
```

# Solution

```clojure
'(1 2 3 4)
```

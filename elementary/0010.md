# Intro to Maps

###### Elementary

###### 

Maps store key-value pairs. Both maps and keywords can be used as lookup functions. Commas can be used to make maps more readable, but they are not required.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= __ ((hash-map :a 10, :b 20, :c 30) :b))
```

```clojure
(= __ (:b {:a 10, :b 20, :c 30}))
```

# Solution

```clojure
20
```

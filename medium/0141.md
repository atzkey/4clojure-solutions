# Tricky card games

In [trick-taking card games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick-taking_game) such as bridge, spades, or hearts, cards are played in groups known as "tricks" - each player plays a single card, in order; the first player is said to "lead" to the trick. After all players have played, one card is said to have "won" the trick. How the winner is determined will vary by game, but generally the winner is the highest card played _in the suit that was led_. Sometimes (again varying by game), a particular suit will be designated "trump", meaning that its cards are more powerful than any others: if there is a trump suit, and any trumps are played, then the highest trump wins regardless of what was led.

Your goal is to devise a function that can determine which of a number of cards has won a trick. You should accept a trump suit, and return a function `winner`. Winner will be called on a sequence of cards, and should return the one which wins the trick. Cards will be represented in the format returned by [Problem 128, Recognize Playing Cards](/problem/128/): a hash-map of `:suit` and a numeric `:rank`. Cards with a larger rank are stronger.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(let [notrump (__ nil)]
  (and (= {:suit :club :rank 9}  (notrump [{:suit :club :rank 4}
                                           {:suit :club :rank 9}]))
       (= {:suit :spade :rank 2} (notrump [{:suit :spade :rank 2}
                                           {:suit :club :rank 10}]))))
```
```clojure
(= {:suit :club :rank 10} ((__ :club) [{:suit :spade :rank 2}
                                       {:suit :club :rank 10}]))
```
```clojure
(= {:suit :heart :rank 8}
   ((__ :heart) [{:suit :heart :rank 6} {:suit :heart :rank 8}
                 {:suit :diamond :rank 10} {:suit :heart :rank 4}]))
```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn game [trump]
  (letfn [
    (card< [c1 c2]
      (cond
        (not= (:suit c1) (:suit c2))
        (and
          (not= (:suit c1) trump)
          (= (:suit c2) trump))
        
        :else
        (and
          (= (:suit c1) (:suit c2))
          (< (:rank c1) (:rank c2)))))]
    (fn [cards] (or
      ((comp last first) (take-while #(apply card< %) (partition 2 1 cards)))
      (first cards)))))
```

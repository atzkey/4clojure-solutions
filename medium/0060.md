# Sequence Reductions

###### Medium
###### #seqs #core-functions

Write a function which behaves like reduce, but returns each intermediate value of the reduction. Your function must accept either two or three arguments, and the return sequence must be lazy.  

<u>Special Restrictions</u>  
- reductions

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= (take 5 (__ + (range))) [0 1 3 6 10])
```
```clojure
(= (__ conj [1] [2 3 4]) [[1] [1 2] [1 2 3] [1 2 3 4]])
```
```clojure
(= (last (__ * 2 [3 4 5])) (reduce * 2 [3 4 5]) 120)
```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn reductions'
  ([f xs] (reductions' f (first xs) (rest xs)))
  ([f init xs]
    (if (nil? xs)
      init
      (cons init
        (lazy-seq
          (when-let [s (seq xs)]
            (reductions' f (f init (first s)) (rest s))))))))
```

A [balanced prime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_prime) is a prime number which is also the mean of the primes directly before and after it in the sequence of valid primes. Create a function which takes an integer n, and returns true iff it is a balanced prime.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= false (__ 4))
```
```clojure
(= true (__ 563))
```
```clojure
(= 1103 (nth (filter __ (range)) 15))
```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn [n]
  (letfn [
    (sieve [s]
      (cons (first s)
            (lazy-seq (sieve (filter #(not= 0 (mod % (first s))) (rest s))))))
    (primes [] (sieve (iterate inc 2)))
    (count-primes-less-than [n] (count (take-while (partial >= n) (primes))))]
      (let [last3 (take-last 3 (take (inc (count-primes-less-than n)) (primes)))]
        (= n (second last3) (/ (+ (first last3) (last last3)) 2)))))
```

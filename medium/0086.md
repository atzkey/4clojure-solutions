# Happy numbers

###### Medium
###### #math

Happy numbers are positive integers that follow a particular formula: take each individual digit, square it, and then sum the squares to get a new number. Repeat with the new number and eventually, you might get to a number whose squared sum is 1. This is a happy number. An unhappy number (or sad number) is one that loops endlessly. Write a function that determines if a number is happy or not.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= (__ 7) true)
```
```clojure
(= (__ 986543210) true)
```
```clojure
(= (__ 2) false)
```
```clojure
(= (__ 3) false)
```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn happy?
  ([n] (happy? n []))
  ([n acc]
    (cond
      (= 1 n) true
      (contains? acc n) false
      :else (happy?
        (->> n
          str seq (map #(Integer. (str %)))
          (map #(* % %)) (reduce +))
        (conj acc n)))))
```

###### Medium
###### #seqs #core-functions

Write a function which returns a map containing the number of occurences of each distinct item in a sequence.  

<u>Special Restrictions</u>  
- frequencies

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= (__ [1 1 2 3 2 1 1]) {1 4, 2 2, 3 1})
```
```clojure
(= (__ [:b :a :b :a :b]) {:a 2, :b 3})
```
```clojure
(= (__ '([1 2] [1 3] [1 3])) {[1 2] 1, [1 3] 2})
```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn freqs
  ([xs] (freqs xs {}))
  ([[x & xs :as lst] result]
    (if (empty? lst)
      result
      (recur xs (assoc result x (inc (get result x 0)))))))
```

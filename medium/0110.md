# Sequence of pronunciations

###### Medium
###### #seqs

Write a function that returns a lazy sequence of "pronunciations" of a sequence of numbers. A pronunciation of each element in the sequence consists of the number of repeating identical numbers and the number itself. For example, `[1 1]` is pronounced as `[2 1]` ("two ones"), which in turn is pronounced as `[1 2 1 1]` ("one two, one one").

Your function should accept an initial sequence of numbers, and return an infinite lazy sequence of pronunciations, each element being a pronunciation of the previous element.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= [[1 1] [2 1] [1 2 1 1]] (take 3 (__ [1])))
```
```clojure
(= [3 1 2 4] (first (__ [1 1 1 4 4])))
```
```clojure
(= [1 1 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 1] (nth (__ [1]) 6))
```
```clojure
(= 338 (count (nth (__ [3 2]) 15)))

```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn pronounce [xs]
  (letfn [
    (pronounce1 [xs]
      (mapcat #(vector (count %) (first %)) (partition-by identity xs)))]
    (lazy-seq (cons (pronounce1 xs) (pronounce (pronounce1 xs))))))
```

# Word Sorting

###### Medium
###### #sorting

Write a function that splits a sentence up into a sorted list of words. Capitalization should not affect sort order and punctuation should be ignored.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= (__  "Have a nice day.")
   ["a" "day" "Have" "nice"])
```
```clojure
(= (__  "Clojure is a fun language!")
   ["a" "Clojure" "fun" "is" "language"])
```
```clojure
(= (__  "Fools fall for foolish follies.")
   ["fall" "follies" "foolish" "Fools" "for"])
```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn [str] (sort-by #(.toLowerCase %) (re-seq #"[A-Za-z]+" str)))
```

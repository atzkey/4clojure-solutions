[take-while](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/take-while) is great for filtering sequences, but it limited: you can only examine a single item of the sequence at a time. What if you need to keep track of some state as you go over the sequence?

Write a function which accepts an integer `n`, a predicate `p`, and a sequence. It should return a lazy sequence of items in the list up to, but not including, the `n`th item that satisfies the predicate.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= [2 3 5 7 11 13]
   (__ 4 #(= 2 (mod % 3))
         [2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23]))
```
```clojure
(= ["this" "is" "a" "sentence"]
   (__ 3 #(some #{\i} %)
         ["this" "is" "a" "sentence" "i" "wrote"]))
```
```clojure
(= ["this" "is"]
   (__ 1 #{"a"}
         ["this" "is" "a" "sentence" "i" "wrote"]))
```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn take-while'
  ([n p xs] (take-while' n p xs []))
  ([n p [x & xs] res]
    (cond
      (zero? n)            res
      (and (= 1 n) (p x)) res
      (p x)               (take-while' (dec n) p xs (conj res x))
      :else               (take-while' n p xs (conj res x)))))
```

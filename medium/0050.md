# Split by Type

###### Medium
###### #seqs

Write a function which takes a sequence consisting of items with different types and splits them up into a set of homogeneous sub-sequences. The internal order of each sub-sequence should be maintained, but the sub-sequences themselves can be returned in any order (this is why 'set' is used in the test cases).

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= (set (__ [1 :a 2 :b 3 :c])) #{[1 2 3] [:a :b :c]})
```
```clojure
(= (set (__ [:a "foo"  "bar" :b])) #{[:a :b] ["foo" "bar"]})
```
```clojure
(= (set (__ [[1 2] :a [3 4] 5 6 :b])) #{[[1 2] [3 4]] [:a :b] [5 6]})
```

# Solution
```clojure
#(->> % (group-by class) vals set)
```

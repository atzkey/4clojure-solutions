# Identify keys and values

###### Medium
###### #maps #seqs

Given an input sequence of keywords and numbers, create a map such that each key in the map is a keyword, and the value is a sequence of all the numbers (if any) between it and the next keyword in the sequence.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= {} (__ []))
```
```clojure
(= {:a [1]} (__ [:a 1]))
```
```clojure
(= {:a [1], :b [2]} (__ [:a 1, :b 2]))
```
```clojure
(= {:a [1 2 3], :b [], :c [4]} (__ [:a 1 2 3 :b :c 4]))
```

# Solution
```clojure
(defn to-map [[x & xs]]
  (if x
    (merge (hash-map x (take-while number? xs)) (to-map (drop-while number? xs)))
    {}))

```

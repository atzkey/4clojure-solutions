When working with java, you often need to create an object with `fieldsLikeThis`, but you'd rather work with a hashmap that has `:keys-like-this` until it's time to convert. Write a function which takes lower-case hyphen-separated strings and converts them to camel-case strings.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= (__ "something") "something")
```
```clojure
(= (__ "multi-word-key") "multiWordKey")
```
```clojure
(= (__ "leaveMeAlone") "leaveMeAlone")
```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn [s]
  (let [
    words (re-seq #"[^\-]+" s)]
    (clojure.string/join (cons (first words) (map clojure.string/capitalize (rest words))))))
```

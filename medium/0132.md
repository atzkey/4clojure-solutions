# Insert between two items

Write a function that takes a two-argument predicate, a value, and a collection; and returns a new collection where the `value` is inserted between every two items that satisfy the predicate.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= '(1 :less 6 :less 7 4 3) (__ 
```
```clojure
(= '(2) (__ > :more [2]))
```
```clojure
(= [0 1 :x 2 :x 3 :x 4]  (__ #(and (pos? %) (
```
```clojure
(empty? (__ > :more ()))
```
```clojure
(= [0 1 :same 1 2 3 :same 5 8 13 :same 21]
   (take 12 (->> [0 1]
                 (iterate (fn [[a b]] [b (+ a b)]))
                 (map first) ; fibonacci numbers
                 (__ (fn [a b] ; both even or both odd
                       (= (mod a 2) (mod b 2)))
                     :same))))
```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn inbetween [pred label [x y & xs :as lst]]
  (lazy-seq
    (cond
      (nil? y) lst
      (pred x y) (concat (list x label) (inbetween pred label (rest lst)))
      :else      (cons x (inbetween pred label (rest lst))))))
```

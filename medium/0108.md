# Lazy Searching

###### Medium
###### #seqs #sorting

Given any number of sequences, each sorted from smallest to largest, find the smallest single number which appears in all of the sequences. The sequences may be infinite, so be careful to search lazily.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= 3 (__ [3 4 5]))
```
```clojure
(= 4 (__ [1 2 3 4 5 6 7] [0.5 3/2 4 19]))
```
```clojure
(= 7 (__ (range) (range 0 100 7/6) [2 3 5 7 11 13]))
```
```clojure
(= 64 (__ (map #(* % % %) (range)) ;; perfect cubes
          (filter #(zero? (bit-and % (dec %))) (range)) ;; powers of 2
          (iterate inc 20))) ;; at least as large as 20
```

# Solution
```clojure
; Smallest common
(fn sc [& lists]
  (let [
    firsts (map first lists)
    smallest (apply min firsts)]
    (cond
      (apply = firsts) smallest
      :else (apply sc (map #(if (= smallest (first %)) (rest %) %) lists)))))
```

# Partially Flatten a Sequence

###### Medium
###### #seqs

Write a function which flattens any nested combination of sequential things (lists, vectors, etc.), but maintains the lowest level sequential items. The result should be a sequence of sequences with only one level of nesting.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= (__ [["Do"] ["Nothing"]])
   [["Do"] ["Nothing"]])
```
```clojure
(= (__ [[[[:a :b]]] [[:c :d]] [:e :f]])
   [[:a :b] [:c :d] [:e :f]])
```
```clojure
(= (__ '((1 2)((3 4)((((5 6)))))))
   '((1 2)(3 4)(5 6)))
```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn [xs]
  (letfn [
      (seq-1? [xs] (and (sequential? xs) (not-any? sequential? xs)))
      (seq-1+? [xs] (and (sequential? xs) (some sequential? xs)))]
    (filter #(or (seq-1? %) ((complement sequential?) %))
      (rest (tree-seq seq-1+? seq xs)))))
```

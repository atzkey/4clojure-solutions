# Read Roman numerals

###### Hard
###### #strings #math

Roman numerals are easy to recognize, but not everyone knows all the rules necessary to work with them. Write a function to parse a Roman-numeral string and return the number it represents.  
  
 You can assume that the input will be well-formed, in upper-case, and follow the [subtractive principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Subtractive_principle). You don't need to handle any numbers greater than MMMCMXCIX (3999), the largest number representable with ordinary letters.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= 14 (__ "XIV"))
```
```clojure
(= 827 (__ "DCCCXXVII"))
```
```clojure
(= 3999 (__ "MMMCMXCIX"))
```
```clojure
(= 48 (__ "XLVIII"))

```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn [roman]
  (letfn [
    (digitize [roman]
      (replace {\I 1 \V 5 \X 10 \L 50 \C 100 \D 500 \M 1000} roman))

    (partition-pairwise [cmp coll]
      (when-let [xs (seq coll)]
        (let [splitpoint (inc (count (take-while (partial apply <) (partition 2 1 xs))))
              [part tail] (split-at splitpoint xs)]
          (cons part (partition-pairwise cmp tail)))))
    ]
    (reduce + (map #(->> % (cons 0) reverse (apply -)) (partition-pairwise < (digitize roman))))))
```

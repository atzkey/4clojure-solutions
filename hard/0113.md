# Making Data Dance

###### Hard
###### #types

Write a function that takes a variable number of integer arguments. If the output is coerced into a string, it should return a comma (and space) separated list of the inputs sorted smallest to largest. If the output is coerced into a sequence, it should return a seq of unique input elements in the same order as they were entered.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= "1, 2, 3" (str (__ 2 1 3)))
```
```clojure
(= '(2 1 3) (seq (__ 2 1 3)))
```
```clojure
(= '(2 1 3) (seq (__ 2 1 3 3 1 2)))
```
```clojure
(= '(1) (seq (apply __ (repeat 5 1))))
```
```clojure
(= "1, 1, 1, 1, 1" (str (apply __ (repeat 5 1))))
```
```clojure
(and (= nil (seq (__)))
     (=  "" (str (__))))
```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn [& xs]
  (reify clojure.lang.Seqable
    (seq [this] (if xs (distinct xs)))
    (toString [this] (apply str (interpose ", " (sort xs))))))
```

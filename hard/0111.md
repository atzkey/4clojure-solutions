# Crossword puzzle

###### Hard
###### #game

Write a function that takes a string and a partially-filled crossword puzzle board, and determines if the input string can be legally placed onto the board.   The crossword puzzle board consists of a collection of partially-filled rows. Empty spaces are denoted with an underscore (\_), unusable spaces are denoted with a hash symbol (#), and pre-filled spaces have a character in place; the whitespace characters are for legibility and should be ignored.  For a word to be legally placed on the board:  - It may use empty spaces (underscores)  - It may use but must not conflict with any pre-filled characters.  - It must not use any unusable spaces (hashes).  - There must be no empty spaces (underscores) or extra characters before or after the word (the word may be bound by unusable spaces though).  - Characters are not case-sensitive.   - Words may be placed vertically (proceeding top-down only), or horizontally (proceeding left-right only).

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= true  (__ "the" ["_ # _ _ e"]))
```
```clojure
(= false (__ "the" ["c _ _ _"
                    "d _ # e"
                    "r y _ _"]))
```
```clojure
(= true  (__ "joy" ["c _ _ _"
                    "d _ # e"
                    "r y _ _"]))
```
```clojure
(= false (__ "joy" ["c o n j"
                    "_ _ y _"
                    "r _ _ #"]))
```
```clojure
(= true  (__ "clojure" ["_ _ _ # j o y"
                        "_ _ o _ _ _ _"
                        "_ _ f _ # _ _"]))

```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn [word crossword]
  (let [
        x crossword
        transpose (fn [m] (apply mapv vector m))
        crossword-1d (map #(clojure.string/escape %1 {\space "" \_ "."})
                       (concat crossword (map clojure.string/join (transpose crossword))))
        variants (mapcat #(clojure.string/split % #"#") crossword-1d)]
    (not (every? nil? (map #(re-matches (re-pattern %) word) variants)))))
```

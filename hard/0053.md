# Longest Increasing Sub-Seq

###### Hard
###### #seqs

Given a vector of integers, find the longest consecutive sub-sequence of increasing numbers. If two sub-sequences have the same length, use the one that occurs first. An increasing sub-sequence must have a length of 2 or greater to qualify.

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= (__ [1 0 1 2 3 0 4 5]) [0 1 2 3])
```
```clojure
(= (__ [5 6 1 3 2 7]) [5 6])
```
```clojure
(= (__ [2 3 3 4 5]) [3 4 5])
```
```clojure
(= (__ [7 6 5 4]) [])
```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn [lst]
  (let [
    ; Generating all subsequences of the list,
    ; and leaving ordered sequences only
    subpartitions (for [i (range (inc (count lst)) 1 -1)]
                    (filter #(apply < %) (partition i 1 lst)))
    ; Grouping them by their respective size
    seqs (group-by #(count %) (map first subpartitions))
    ; Finally, selecting the longest ordered subsequence
    max-seq (last (get seqs (apply max (keys seqs))))]
    (if (> (count max-seq) 1)
      max-seq
      [])))
```

# Gus' Quinundrum

###### Hard
###### #logic #fun #brain-teaser

Create a function of no arguments which returns a string that is an _exact_ copy of the function itself.  
  
 Hint: read [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)) if you get stuck (this question is harder than it first appears); but it's worth the effort to solve it independently if you can!  
  
 Fun fact: Gus is the name of the [4Clojure dragon](http://i.imgur.com/FBd8z.png).

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= (str '__) (__))
```

# Solution
```clojure
((fn [] (let [q (first (Character/toChars 34)) s "(fn [] (let [q (first (Character/toChars 34)) s %s%s%s] (apply str (format s q (apply str s) q))))"] (apply str (format s q (apply str s) q)))))
```

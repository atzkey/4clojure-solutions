###### #strings #game

Following on from [Recognize Playing Cards](http://www.4clojure.com/problem/128), determine the best poker hand that can be made with five cards. The hand rankings are listed below for your convenience.

1. Straight flush: All cards in the same suit, and in sequence
2. Four of a kind: Four of the cards have the same rank
3. Full House: Three cards of one rank, the other two of another rank
4. Flush: All cards in the same suit
5. Straight: All cards in sequence (aces can be high or low, but not both at once)
6. Three of a kind: Three of the cards have the same rank
7. Two pair: Two pairs of cards have the same rank
8. Pair: Two cards have the same rank
9. High card: None of the above conditions are met

# Test Cases
```clojure
(= :high-card (__ ["HA" "D2" "H3" "C9" "DJ"]))
```
```clojure
(= :pair (__ ["HA" "HQ" "SJ" "DA" "HT"]))
```
```clojure
(= :two-pair (__ ["HA" "DA" "HQ" "SQ" "HT"]))
```
```clojure
(= :three-of-a-kind (__ ["HA" "DA" "CA" "HJ" "HT"]))
```
```clojure
(= :straight (__ ["HA" "DK" "HQ" "HJ" "HT"]))
```
```clojure
(= :straight (__ ["HA" "H2" "S3" "D4" "C5"]))
```
```clojure
(= :flush (__ ["HA" "HK" "H2" "H4" "HT"]))
```
```clojure
(= :full-house (__ ["HA" "DA" "CA" "HJ" "DJ"]))
```
```clojure
(= :four-of-a-kind (__ ["HA" "DA" "CA" "SA" "DJ"]))
```
```clojure
(= :straight-flush (__ ["HA" "HK" "HQ" "HJ" "HT"]))

```

# Solution
```clojure
(fn [cards]
  (letfn [
    (card [[suit rank]]
      {:suit ({\D :diamond \H :heart \S :spade \C :club} suit)
       :rank ((zipmap "23456789TJQKA" (range)) rank)})
    (card-pairs [xs] (->> xs
      sort
      reverse
      (partition 2 1)))
    (in-sequence? [xs] (and (every? #(= 1 (apply - %)) (rest (card-pairs xs)))))]
    (let [
      hand (map card cards)
      flat-ranks (map :rank hand)
      by-rank (group-by :rank hand)
      counts-by-rank (map count (vals by-rank))
      by-suit (group-by :suit hand)
      ranks (count by-rank)
      suits (count by-suit)]
      (cond
        (= 1 suits) (if (in-sequence? (map :rank (flatten (vals by-suit)))) :straight-flush :flush)
        (= 2 ranks) (case (apply max counts-by-rank)
                          4 :four-of-a-kind
                          3 :full-house)
        (= 3 ranks) (case (apply max counts-by-rank)
                          3 :three-of-a-kind
                          2 :two-pair)
        (in-sequence? flat-ranks) :straight
        (= 4 ranks) :pair
        :else       :high-card)
      )))
```
